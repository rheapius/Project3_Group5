# Top 10 songs & artists

## Overview:
Visualize top 10 songs & artists based on streaming. 
Song aspects visualized.

## Aim
The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in Spotify’s playlist for 2023. We’ll examine what makes a song popular and whether the songs are similarly popular on other streaming platforms.
To do this we will examine the beats per minute, the main key of the music and whether a particular artist features more prominently in the charts.

## Data cleaning 
The data was obtained as a CSV file and then cleaned up using Jupyter notebook. The NAN values were removed, columns renamed and string values were converted to numeric values. These csv files have been saved in the 'Data cleaning' folder.
The Jupyter notebook used to clean the data has also been saved in this folder.

## Database loading
